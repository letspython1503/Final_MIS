# MIS Dashboard for Trading Call Analysis

This project is an interactive Management Information System (MIS) dashboard built to analyze the performance of trading calls generated by research analysts at **Bigul**, an algo-trading platform by **Bonanza**. The application provides a multi-level analytical view with dynamic filtering capabilities to transform raw data into actionable insights.

This project was developed as part of the **Product Developer Internship** program.

## 🚀 Features

- **Gross Level Summary**  
  An aggregated view of all trading calls, providing a high-level overview of overall performance.  
  It displays key metrics like total calls, target hits, and stop-loss hits.

- **Analyst Level Summary**  
  A granular view to assess the performance of individual analysts.  
  Users can select a specific analyst by their User ID to view their performance metrics and call history.

- **Detailed Drill-Down View**  
  A dedicated page to analyze performance for a specific period (monthly or yearly).  
  This view ranks user performance and further breaks it down by exchange and market segment.

- **Dynamic Filtering**  
  The dashboard is highly interactive, allowing users to filter data by:
  - User ID (Analyst)
  - Custom Date Range
  - Exchange (NSE, MCX)
  - Market Segment (Equity, Futures, Options)

- **Comprehensive KPIs**
  - Total number of calls
  - Target Hit and Stop-Loss Hit counts and percentages
  - Performance of closed calls (Positive, Negative, Redundant)
  - Status of open calls based on the Last Traded Price (LTP)

- **Performance by Call Type**  
  The backend script automatically categorizes each call (e.g., 'Momentum', 'Intraday', 'Positional') based on keywords, allowing for strategy-wise performance analysis.
